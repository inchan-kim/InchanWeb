      <h2>Research for Everyone</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of academic writing is dense and full of jargon. On this page,
        I explain the ideas behind my research in plain language and focus on
        one simple question:
        <strong>why should a non-academic care?</strong>

      <h2>How We Talk About Technology</h2>

          <h3>Stories Shape What We Build</h3>
          <p class="tagline">How everyday people influence the future of technology</p>
          <p>
            One line of my research looks at how people talk about new tech
            (for example, fitness trackers on social media) and how those
            conversations add up to a shared story about what the technology is
            “for.” This shared story influences what products companies build,
            how regulators react, and what customers expect.
          </p>
          <p class="why">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
            When we think technology is only shaped by big companies or
            experts, we overlook the power of everyday users. Our tweets,
            reviews, and conversations are not just reactions—they help decide
            which technologies thrive and how they are used.

          <h3>When Hype Helps (and Hurts)</h3>
          <p class="tagline">From excitement to disappointment and back again</p>
          <p>
            I also study how enthusiasm, skepticism, and criticism rise and
            fall around technologies over time. There is often a wave of early
            excitement, followed by frustration or backlash, and sometimes a
            more balanced view emerges later.
          </p>
          <p class="why">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
            Understanding these cycles can help consumers make smarter choices,
            help entrepreneurs time their products better, and help policymakers
            avoid over-reacting to hype or panic.

          <h3>Life Inside App Ecosystems</h3>
          <p class="tagline">Why developers stay (or leave) digital platforms</p>
          <p>
            Some of my work examines app developers who build on platforms like
            mobile app stores. I look at what keeps them engaged, what pushes
            them away, and how platform rules and revenue-sharing shape their
            decisions.
          </p>
          <p class="why">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
            Healthy app ecosystems depend on independent developers. If the
            rules feel unfair or unstable, innovation slows down and users get
            fewer choices.

          <h3>How Mission Guides Digital Strategy</h3>
          <p class="tagline">Why a company's purpose still matters in a digital world</p>
          <p>
            I study how a company’s mission—its underlying purpose—guides the
            way it builds and evolves digital platforms. Even in fast-moving,
            high-tech markets, the mission can explain why two firms facing the
            same disruption respond very differently.
          </p>
          <p class="why">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
            For entrepreneurs and leaders, digital strategy is not just about
            copying the latest trend. It works best when it fits the deeper
            values and goals of the organization.

          <h3>Do Diversity and Inclusion Affect Markets?</h3>
          <p class="tagline">DEI initiatives and stock prices</p>
          <p>
            Another stream of my research asks how corporate efforts in
            diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are viewed by financial
            markets—especially when the rights of vulnerable groups are under
            political pressure.
          </p>
          <p class="why">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
            These projects speak to a basic question: are social and ethical
            commitments “nice-to-have,” or do they shape how investors value
            firms and how society responds in times of tension?

          <h3>Beyond Short-Term Numbers</h3>
          <p class="tagline">ESG, long-term value, and real people</p>
          <p>
            I look at environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives
            not just as checkboxes, but as choices that affect employees,
            customers, and communities over time.
          </p>
          <p class="why">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
            For students, investors, and citizens, it is helpful to see how
            financial outcomes and social outcomes are linked instead of being
            treated as opposites.

          <h3>Using Data to Study the Digital World</h3>
          <p class="tagline">From tweets to platforms to markets</p>
          <p>
            Many of my projects use large-scale digital traces (such as social
            media posts or platform data) combined with advanced analytics and
            AI techniques. The goal is not just to build models, but to learn
            something meaningful about people, organizations, and society.
          </p>
          <p class="why">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
            Our lives are increasingly recorded in digital form. Thoughtful use
            of these data can help us understand emerging issues early, while
            still being mindful of ethics, bias, and privacy.
